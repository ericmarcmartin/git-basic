https://github.com/ericmarcmartin/git-basic.git
2. Your answer for What is the difference between `add`, `commit`, and `push`?
The `add` in git adds changes or updates from the user's working directory to the
staging area. However, changes are still not recorded until command `commit` is executed.
Git command `commit` takes everything from the staging area and capture snapshot of
user's repository. This snapshot will then be uploaded to the remote repository after
git command `push` is executed.
